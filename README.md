# Project for How to Write Fast Code
This is the work for a semester long project in making an algorithm run optimally on a target
hardware architecture. The project uses the source code from
https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~games/Sokoban/program.html and optimizes the program to run more efficiently on a Intel Xeon E52680 processor.
