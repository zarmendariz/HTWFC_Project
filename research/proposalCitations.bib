abstract = {Sokoban is a classic puzzle game invented in Japan. The original game of SOKOBAN was written by Hiroyuki Imabayashi.

Today Sokoban is one of the most popular thought and logic games.

The name comes from Japan and means "warehouse keeper".

As simple as that name is, so is the idea of this game: A level represents a store room, where boxes appear to be randomly placed. You help the warehouse keeper to push the boxes around the maze of the room so that, at the end, all boxes are on marked fields. The only restrictions are that the warehouse keeper can only push a box, never pull, and that just one box may be pushed at a time.

Each level has a different structure, which requires a different solution - often with a different strategy as well. The magic of the game is that boxes, which are out of the way on one move, might be in the way on the next move.

The simplicity of the rules, in combination with the many levels ranging from easy to extremely difficult, have made Sokoban become a real classic.

This Wiki is dedicated to this exciting game.},

abstract = {The game of Sokoban is an interesting platform for algorithm research. It is hard for
humans and computers alike. Even with its simple rules and small average level sizes there
are levels that take a lot of computation for all known algorithms.
In this thesis we will combine different Sokoban solvers with different domain specific
enhancements into one portfolio. This portfolio can then be run in parallel on one problem
until one solver finds a solution. Additionally the solvers in the portfolio can exchange data
to speed up computation.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence is becoming instrumental in a variety of applications. Games serve as a good breeding ground for trying and testing these algorithms in a sandbox with simpler constraints in comparison to real life. In this project, we aim to develop an AI agent that can solve the classical Japanese game of Sokoban using various algorithms and heuristics and compare their performances through standard metrics.},
